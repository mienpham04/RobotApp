# Robot Game Application

## Overview

**Robot Game** is a JavaFX-based application where users control a robot navigating through a grid, avoiding enemies and obstacles. The game is built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring scalable and maintainable code. The modular class and interface system enhances component interaction and simplifies the game logic.

## Gameplay

- **Control the Robot**: Players guide a robot across a grid while avoiding enemies.
- **Avoid Enemies**: The goal is to safely maneuver through the grid without colliding with enemies.
- **Responsive UI**: The game interface is intuitive, with improved UX/UI design for smooth user interactions.
  
## Features
